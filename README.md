# TODO
- ~~add counting total sus produced~~ -> done, missing compatibility for older versions (see if possible otherwise just make everyone restart, it's easy to calculate total sus produced but for each helper it' a bit more complex, thinking of just going by percentage of total sps, which isn't accurate, but oh well) 
- ~~add counting total sus produced per each helper~~ -> same issue as above
- fix tooltip positioning with js
- add upgrade buying functionality and whole support for it
- fix game not working when page not in focus
- buy 1, 10 or 100 modifiers
- sell option
- buy all upgrades option
- add case where building isn't owned yet in displaying cards
- add visual indicator when clicking
- add color filters on upgrades

# DONE
- add color filter or not option since I might not want to add color fiters for some
- add function reference instead of "normal" for upgrades that might have side effects other than doubling the sps
- fix tooltip design
